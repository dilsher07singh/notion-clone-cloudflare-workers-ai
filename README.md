# Cloudflare Workers for AI-Powered Server and Language Processing

This project leverages **Cloudflare Workers** to serve as both an **AI-driven backend** and a **lightweight, globally distributed server**.

Currently, it is being used for:

### ðŸ”¹ **Text Summarization**

Generating concise yet meaningful summaries from input documents using **Cloudflare Workers AI**.

### ðŸ”¹ **Language Translation**

Translating text into different languages with high accuracy and efficiency.
